>So you want to learn the art of [[📇 Terms/🧠 Knowledge Systems/🌳 Digital Garden|🌳 Digital Gardening]]? We'll you've come to the right place - here in my [[🪴 Grow Room]] you can see some seeds that have already been planted.
>First of all, lets get you thinking about what you want to grow!

## 🌱 What is a Seed?

A 🌱 seed in the [[📇 Terms/🧠 Knowledge Systems/🌳 Digital Garden|🌳 Digital Garden]] is any kind of document you create that contains ideas, thoughts, resources and other collected things.

When you create a new document it goes into the **🌱 Seed Box** folder - an inbox of unsorted items that you collect during the day. Don't be afraid to fill it up the aim is to let you just capture your stream of thoughts - but it's important that you triage regularly.

There are a list of [[#⏣ Seed Templates]] below - when a new seed is created it appears in the [[🪴 Grow Room]] (along with **🪵 Backlog** items).

To create a new file from a template - use the [[Command Pallete]] and select `Templater: Create new note from template` (or **⌘ + ⌥ + n** on OSX).

## 💡 Planting Seeds (Triage)

When an item is in the 🌱 Seed Box it has a `status::` property set to `#triage`.  The first thing to do is to select where it goes:

- Use the **🪵 Backlog** folder as a place where you have items you want to deal with in a short amount of time, but don't yet want to categorise.
- Place the file with in a [[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪴 Sowing Your Garden/🏭  Project Stucture|🗂 Project folder]] for files related to a particular topic you are researching
- If it's a [[⏣ Templates/👤 New Person]], [[⏣ Templates/🪛 Todo List]] or [[⏣ Templates/🔖 New Term]] you can place them in the dedicated folders

When you remove it, update the `status::` field - see [[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪴 Sowing Your Garden/⚠️ Statuses|⚠️ Statuses]] on how to use this to help drive [[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪴 Sowing Your Garden/🎯  Create Custom Dashboards|🎯 Custom Dashboards]].
